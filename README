NAME
    HTML::Untemplate - undo what the template engine does

VERSION
    version 0.002

DESCRIPTION
    Despite being named similarly to HTML::Template, this distribution is
    not directly related to it. Instead, it attempts to reverse the
    templating action, whatever the template agent used.

  Why?
    Suppose you have a CMS. Typical CMS works roughly as this (data flows
    bottom-down):

                RDBMS
          scripting language
                 HTML
             HTTP server
                (...)
              HTTP agent
            layout engine
                screen
                 user

    Consider the first 3 steps: "RDBMS => scripting language => HTML"

    This is "applying template".

    Now, consider this: "HTML => scripting language => RDBMS"

    I would call that "un-applying template", or "untemplate" ":)"

    The practical application of this set of tools to assist in creation of
    web scrappers.

  CLI tools
   xpathify
    The xpathify tool flatterns the HTML tree into key/value list:

        <!DOCTYPE html>
        <html>
            <head>
                <title>Hello HTML</title>
            </head>
            <body>
                <h1>Hello World!</h1>
                <p>This is a sample HTML</p>
                Beware!
                <p>HTML is <b>not</b> XML!</p>
                Have a nice day.
            </body>
        </html>

    Becomes:

    The keys are in XPath format, while the values are respective content
    from the HTML tree. Theoretically, it could be possible to reassemble
    the HTML tree from the flat key/value list this tool generates.

   untemplate
    The untemplate tool flatterns a set of HTML documents using the
    algorithm from xpathify. Then, it strips the shared key/value pairs. The
    "rest" is composed of original values fed into the template engine.

    And this is how the result actually looks like with some simple
    real-world examples (quotes 1839 <http://bash.org/?1839> and 2486
    <http://bash.org/?2486> from bash.org <http://bash.org/>):

  Modules
    May be used to serialize/flattern HTML documents:

    *   HTML::Linear - represent HTML::Tree as a flat list

    *   HTML::Linear::Element - represent elements to populate HTML::Linear

    *   HTML::Linear::Path - represent paths inside HTML::Tree

    *   HTML::TreeBuilder

    *   HTML::Similarity

    *   XML::DifferenceMarkup
